## Evaluating and Categorizing Ideas
1. Mood Tracker
    - **Description**
        - An app that allows the user to track their daily habits. Each habit will be represented as a circular progress bar. Logging a completed habit would increase a user's streak, leading to possible achievements. The user can make reminders for themselves if they are important.

    - **Category:** Lifestyle
    - **Mobile:**
        - Having this format of a daily tracker exceeds a website, because users are able to have a digital journal on their phones
        - Users will also be able to log their habits in real time, which will be saved into the app as well.
    - **Story:**
        - The value in this app is that it provides a digital alternative to physical bullet journals, which could be time consuming to some users
        - Users will also be able to use it as a general reminder app, but with some gamification implemented to help incentivize upkeeping their important habits
        - Since I have multiple friends who are in college, I think I would have a good reaction from my friends if this app were to be released as college students generally get really busy and forget their healthier habits
    - **Market:**
        - The potential user base is speculated to be high school to adult women who need to keep track of important habits
        - Could expand to a more general audience as well due to its usability
    - **Habit:**
        - It is speculated that an average user would open this app at least once a day because they would have the incentive to log their daily habits
        - An average user would be creating with this app
    - **Scope:**
        - This application is estimated to be slightly more challenging than the past labs that we were given because more elements are added such as circular progress bars, achievements and reminders
        - A stripped version that excludes the reminders would still be interesting, because there is an audience who would enjoy seeing their habits displayed for them

2. Grocery Inventory Tracking
    - **Description**
        - Users can record the expiration date of grocery items they bought from store and keep track of availability to prevent food waste. Utilize reminders!
    - **Category:** Lifestyle
    - **Mobile:**
        - Similar to all the other apps on this list, having this tracker on mobile makes it accessible. Reminders are best utilized on mobile.
    - **Story:**
        - The value in this app is clear in the sense that many people often forget about their food expiring, especially if times get busy or if they are not using ingredients too often.
    - **Market:**
        - The main audience would be people in college and above. Especially those who cook or maintain a household.
    - **Habit:**
        - An average user is speculated to use this app a few times a week, especially times when they are about to cook
        - More consuming than creating 
    - **Scope:**
        - Might need to implement a internal timer to accommodate for reminders for expiration dates
        - Other than that, not too much difficult than course content
4. Couple's Calendar
    - **Description**
        - Keep track of important dates and events in a calendar along with your significant other. Users will be able to upload pictures and write notes to each event created to commemorate.
    - **Category:** Social/Entertainment
    - **Mobile:**
        - Similar to the other apps, this exceeds a website because it is mobile and easily accessible. Reminders will be best utilized on mobile as well.
        - Uploading pictures will be easier through mobile phones too.
    - **Story:**
        - This app is of value to couples, especially long-distance couples.
        - My peers would react positively to this!
    - **Market:**
        - The speculated audience are couples who are in high school up to 50-60 year olds. 
    - **Habit:**
        - Since the application would be confined for two users, they will be creating more.
        - It is speculated that they would open the app at most once a day to create, but possibly multiple times to admire their work or content.
    - **Scope:**
        - If created without thinking about a second user, this app is not too much difficult than what the course has taught us.
        - But it would get more difficult if we reach a certain point and have to add a second user to sync user defaults.
